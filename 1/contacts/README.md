AngularJS
==============


A series in which I'll be teaching myself AngularJS. Most days in the blogging series will be distinguishable by the commits I do, and I'll try to keep it as orginized as possible.

The best way to keep track of what I'm learning and doing would be to visit my blog at: www.bentoussi.com
